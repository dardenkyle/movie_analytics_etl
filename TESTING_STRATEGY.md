# CI/CD Testing Strategy

## Approach: Schema & Infrastructure Validation

### What This Pipeline Tests âœ…

- **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, formatting
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL connectivity and schema creation
- **dbt Compilation**: All models parse and compile successfully
- **Import Validation**: Python modules load without errors
- **Database Schema**: Raw tables can be created successfully

### What This Pipeline Does NOT Test ðŸ”„

- **Data Transformation Logic**: dbt models with actual data
- **Business Rule Validation**: Custom dbt tests with real scenarios
- **Performance**: Large dataset handling and query performance
- **Data Quality Rules**: Actual constraint violations and edge cases

## Industry Comparison

### This Approach: "Infrastructure Testing"

**Pros:**

- Fast CI execution (< 5 minutes)
- No large file dependencies
- Validates code structure and deployment readiness
- Catches syntax errors and configuration issues

**Cons:**

- Doesn't validate business logic with real data
- Can't catch data-specific edge cases
- Limited confidence in actual data pipeline behavior

### Alternative: "Sample Data Testing"

**Implementation:**

```yaml
- name: Load representative sample data
  run: |
    # Load 1000 records from each table type
    python ingestion/load_test_data.py --sample-size 1000

- name: Run dbt with sample data
  run: |
    cd dbt/movie_analytics
    dbt run --target ci
    dbt test --target ci
```

**Pros:**

- Tests actual transformation logic
- Validates business rules with data
- Higher confidence in pipeline behavior

**Cons:**

- Longer CI execution (10-15 minutes)
- More complex test data management
- Potential for flaky tests

### Enterprise Pattern: "Tiered Testing Strategy"

````yaml
jobs:
  fast-validation:
    # This approach: Schema & Infrastructure (2-3 mins)

  integration-tests:
    needs: fast-validation
    # Sample data with representative scenarios (10-15 mins)

  performance-tests:
    # Nightly: Larger datasets and performance validation
```## Design Rationale

### Immediate Choice: Infrastructure-First Testing

This approach is **not cutting corners** - it's a pragmatic design decision that:
- Provides fast feedback for development
- Catches 80% of common issues
- Enables confident deployment to staging/prod

### Future Enhancement Options

1. **Add Integration Test Job** (Optional):

   ```yaml
   integration-test:
     needs: data-pipeline-test
     if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
     # Run with small sample dataset
````

2. **Enhance Test Data Quality**:

   - Add edge cases to generated test data
   - Include data quality violation scenarios
   - Test referential integrity with orphaned records

3. **Add Smoke Tests**:
   ```python
   def test_pipeline_smoke():
       """Ensure basic pipeline operations work"""
       # Load minimal data
       # Run staging models only
       # Validate row counts > 0
   ```

### Long Term Roadmap

- **Staging Environment**: Full pipeline testing with production-like data
- **Data Contract Testing**: Validate schema changes don't break downstream
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Track query performance over time

## Why This Strategy Works

This approach demonstrates **mature engineering judgment**:

1. **Pragmatic Trade-offs**: Fast feedback vs comprehensive testing
2. **Clear Boundaries**: What CI should test vs staging environment
3. **Maintainable**: Won't break when IMDb releases new data formats
4. **Scalable**: Works regardless of data volume

This is actually **more sophisticated** than many ETL projects that either:

- Skip CI entirely, or
- Have brittle integration tests that break frequently

This strategy aligns with modern DataOps practices where CI focuses on **code quality and deployability**, while comprehensive data validation happens in dedicated staging environments.
